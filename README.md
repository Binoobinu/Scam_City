🚨 Scam City — Real-Time Voice Phishing Detection

Real-time scam risk detection for phone calls, powered by AI.

Scam City is an experimental research project aimed at detecting voice phishing (보이스피싱) in real time.
The goal is simple but ambitious:

📞 While the user is on a phone call, show a live risk bar that warns whether the conversation is likely a scam.

This project blends speech recognition, NLP-based phishing classification, and a lightweight frontend UI into a prototype that can run locally or inside Docker.
